      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-marriage-matters&#34;&gt;Why Marriage Matters&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently on X, there was a small movement proclaiming the value of marriage.&#xA;These are my thoughts on the matter.&#xA;Note to reader: this article is an incomplete draft, but it is online so I can share it with those I&amp;rsquo;d like to review it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;declaring-the-base&#34;&gt;Declaring the Base&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a Christian, there are certain things I believe about marriage as a direct result of Scripture, and some of those principles are foundational to the conclusions I will draw in this article.&#xA;As a result, I will mention them here before beginning.&#xA;I mention these specifically to support my conclusions and not with the intent to incite debate.&#xA;If you disagree with one or more of these principles, then you may not agree with some of my conclusions, as my conclusions are drawn in part from these foundational principles.&#xA;Also, I do not mention these principles from any position of moral superiority, for I am a sinner in dire need of Jesus Christ.&#xA;As Paul said:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My First Post</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Brycicle on X, and this is the blog that I promised.&#xA;I really ought to have a more meaningful first post to my site, but I spent most of my side project time on getting the thing up and running.&#xA;This website is currently using Hugo to manage the content and GitHub Pages to host it.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m no expert on the stuff, but there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of tutorials and documentation online (plus LLMs).&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend the combination if you want a simple static site with some blog content (I don&amp;rsquo;t have any meaningful links up yet, but I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine those are too hard to add once I learn Hugo more).&#xA;No reason to pay for hosting or a blog service if your needs are simple and static, and you could even go simpler with something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://bearblog.dev/&#34;&gt;bearblog.dev&lt;/a&gt; if you don&amp;rsquo;t want a custom domain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
